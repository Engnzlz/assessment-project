            <p><span class="customer">Customer:</span> I've been using the baby monitor and it's been really helpful. But I'm not sure how to interpret the skin temperature readings. Can you explain?</p>
            <p><span class="representative">Customer Service Representative:</span> The baby monitor's skin temperature feature helps you keep track of your baby's body temperature. If the skin temperature is too high or too low, it can indicate that your baby is either too warm or too cold. It's a useful tool to ensure your baby is comfortable and to prevent overheating or hypothermia.</p>

            <p><span class="customer">Customer:</span> I've noticed that the baby monitor has a lot of features. Can you explain how the monitoring works?</p>
            <p><span class="representative">Customer Service Representative:</span> Absolutely! The baby monitor provides continuous monitoring of your baby's vital signs, including heart rate and skin temperature. This real-time monitoring helps you stay informed about your baby's safety and well-being.</p>
            <p><span class="customer">Customer:</span> That's really reassuring. So if there's any issue, the monitor will alert me immediately?</p>
            <p><span class="representative">Customer Service Representative:</span> Yes, exactly. The monitor is designed to alarm you if any of the baby's vitals, such as blood oxygen or pulse rate falls outside of preset ranges, and will alert you if there are any changes in the room conditions, baby's sleep position, among others.</p>

            <p><span class="customer">Customer:</span> I've been reading about Stork products, and I see it tracks both pulse rate and blood oxygen levels. Can you explain them?</p>
            <p><span class="representative">Customer Service Representative:</span> Of course! The pulse rate indicates how fast your baby's heart is beating. A normal pulse rate can vary depending on age, but it's important to ensure it stays within a healthy range.</p>
            <p><span class="customer">Customer:</span> And what about blood oxygen levels?</p>
            <p><span class="representative">Customer Service Representative:</span> Blood oxygen levels measure how well oxygen is being distributed throughout your baby's body. This is important because oxygen is essential for all bodily functions. The monitor will alarm you if the blood oxygen level drops below a certain threshold.</p>
